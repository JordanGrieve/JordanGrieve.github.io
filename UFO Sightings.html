                                    <p class="mb-0 text-white-50">Firstly, in terms of chronology order – Mr. Arnolds encounter. Mr. Arnold claimed he saw a string of nine, shiny unidentified flying objects flying at an estimated minimum speed of 1,200 miles an hour while he was flying over Mount Rainer. What made this story so big is that it was the first sighting post world war 2, in the United States and over the next weeks led to numerous reports of sightings, one of which included Rosewell’s sighting. </p>

                                    <p class="mb-0 text-white-50"> As mentioned before Rosewell’s sighting, also known as the mother of UFO sightings, took place in 1947 just a couple weeks after Mr. Arnolds encounter, this will be my second UFO sighting. A rancher named Mac Brazel found something abnormal in his fields about 75 miles away from the town of Roswell, New Mexico; metals sticks held with tape, lumps of plastic and foil reflectors and scrapes of heavy, glossy, paper-like material. Unknown what to do with this mess, Mr. Brazel called the Roswell’s sheriff – who called the Rosewell Army Air Force who came and swept the peculiar equipment into their armoured trucks.</p>

                                    <p class="mb-0 text-white-50">Next is the Betty and Barney Hill abduction. Betty and Barney were an American couple who claimed they were abducted by aliens in New Hampshire from 19th to 20th of September. I picked this story as it was the first widely publicized report of an alien abduction in the United States which resulted in their story becoming the best-selling book “The Interrupted Journey” in 1966 and later adapted to a Television movie “The UFO Incident” in 1975. The alleged UFO story by the Hill’s was that betty observed a bright point of light in the sky, moving abruptly and asked her husband to have a closer look which the light kept coming closer and closer to them. The Hills were driving away from the bright light that was quickly descending towards them but the light was to fast and would momentarily hover above the couples car and the Hills heard a buzzing sound and then they “experienced the onset of an altered state of consciousness that left their minds dulled”. After a second episode of buzzing things revert back to normality but they had driven around 35 miles south but couldn’t recognise the road and only able to remember making an unplanned sharp turn, encountering a roadblock and overserving a fiery orb in the road. </p>

                                    <p class="mb-0 text-white-50"> Lastly, in December 1980, the United States Air Force had stationed two British Royal Air Force Bases, Woodbridge and Bentwaters, where both reported seeing unfamiliar, colourful lights above Rendlesham Forest. One  man entered the forest to inspect the lights who later claimed to have stumbled upon some sort of spacecraft there and others also confirmed damage to surrounding nearby tress and recorded higher than normal level of radiation in the forest. Lieutenant Colonel Charles Halt recorded his encounter on audio tape. This is considered by many theorists that this is the strongest evidence of the events and there’s now an official Rendlesham UFO trail that tourist and visitors can hike.</p>
